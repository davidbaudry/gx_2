**Game Board Scorer 2**  : an OO PHP application from legacy

I wrote a time ago a web php app to keep boardgames scores, players, games etc.
It's procedural and old school.

I will make a new major version using better practice, OOP, php7 features (?) etc.
It will be a sample product for me to use :
- [ ] POO - WIP
- [x] PDO - OK
- [ ] COLLECTIONS - WIP
- [ ] MANAGERS - WIP
- [ ] INTERFACES - WIP
- [ ] (HERITAGE) - WIP
- [ ] TRAITS - WIP
- [ ] NAMESPACES - TODO
- [ ] BOOTSTRAP - WIP
- [ ] CALISTHEANS OBJECTS PRACTICES - TODO


REM :
Also use :
- [ ] FILTERS_VALIDATE / TRAITS
- [ ] JS VALIDATION (FORMS)
- [ ] PASSWORD ENCRYPT
